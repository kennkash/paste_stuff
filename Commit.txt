fix(portal-jql-table): use issue-level serviceDeskId for customer portal links

Previously, JQL table links used the portal-level serviceDeskId,
causing non-JSM issues to incorrectly resolve to
/servicedesk/customer/portal/{id}/{issueKey} and return 404.

Now links are determined per issue using issue.serviceDeskId,
falling back to /browse/{issueKey} for non-JSM issues.

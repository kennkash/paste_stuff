Force hard navigation for /servicedesk/customer/portals to ensure RAIL redirect

JSM breadcrumb navigation to /servicedesk/customer/portals uses SPA routing,
which prevents the RailCustomerPortalRedirectFilter from executing.

This update extends rail-portal-intercept.js to:
- Intercept navigation to /servicedesk/customer/portals
- Force a full page reload
- Allow server-side redirect to /plugins/servlet/customer-rail

Also improves anchor detection using closest('a[href]') and normalizes path comparisons.

No backend changes.
